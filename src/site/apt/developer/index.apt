  DM Assist is written in Java, with a Swing UI.  It is built with
  Maven.  Loading and saving is done via
  {{{http://jyaml.sourceforge.net/}jYaml}}.

  The UI and underlying model are split into a model-view split.  This
  should make it easier to port to a new UI (like how Eric is
  threatening to port DM Assist to APT).
